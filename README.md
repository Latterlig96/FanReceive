# FanReceive

Simple project that was build mostly for interview process for FanServ company (They serve and we receive :D).

## How it works

Project aims to build a simple platform for customer to register and then login (with the help of JWT authentication), create bids for matches that 
they think are most interesting and earn money if the bid was successfull for them!

## Functionalities
* JWT Authentication
* Ability to regsiter
* Create bids
* List your bids
* Get your settings
* Get all available matches

And all of this can be easily accessed through API!

### Stack
* Django
* Django Rest Framework
* Celery and Celery Beat
* Redis 
* PostgreSQL
